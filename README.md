# 🚦 Traffic Volume Prediction using Machine Learning (Flask + Sklearn + HTML)

This project is a web-based application that predicts traffic volume based on weather and time-related features using a Machine Learning model built with **Scikit-learn**, served through **Flask**, and presented via a simple **HTML frontend**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build an interactive web app that helps users predict the traffic volume on roads by analyzing weather conditions and time features using a trained regression model.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Model Type:** Regression
- **Library Used:** `Scikit-learn`
- **Algorithm Used:** You may update this depending on what you used (e.g., `LinearRegression`, `RandomForestRegressor`, etc.)
- **Dataset:** The model is trained on historical traffic data, which includes features like temperature, rain, snow, holidays, and time of day.

## 🚀 Features

- Predict traffic volume using real-time or user-entered values.
- Flask-based backend to serve predictions.
- HTML-based UI for easy interaction.
- Returned the prediction bottom of the same page.
